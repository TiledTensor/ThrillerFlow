//! A DataFlow Analyise and Codegen Compiler written in Rust.
//!
//! In ThrillerFlow, we introduce a nested multi-dimendional dataflow
//! graph called Extended task Dependence Graph(ETDG), a unified intermediate
//! representation that preserves a holistic view of parallelism and
//! dependency across different control and data nested levels on the code.
//! To facilitate code analysis and the later low-level code generation,
//! an ETDG concisely encodes complex control structures and precisely
//! represents the iteration-level data dependencies with and acyclic graph.
//! For a clear exposition, ETDG borrows the concepts from the reduced dependence
//! graph used classical compilers with the Static Control Program(SCoP) modeling
//! employed in polyhedral compilers.
//!
//! In ThrillerFlow, we introduce some important data structures:
//!
//! - [`ThrillerBlock`] represents the data-parallel repetition of a
//!   dataflow task int form of a d-dimensional dataflow node.
//! - [`AttachedEdge`] is an edge that connects a source and destination buffer
//!   with additional access pattern information [`AccessMap`].
//! - [`AccessMap`] represents a multi-dimensional access pattern.
//! - [`ThrillerGraph`] represents a d-dimensional dataflow task graph within nested loops.
//! - [`ThrillerNode`] represents an abstract node element that can represent a Buffer Node,
//!   Operator Node and Block Node.
//! - [`ThrillerEdge`] represents the edge connecting two [`ThrillerNode`]s in a directed
//!   acyclic graph.
//! - [`Buffer`] represents an addressable instance declared in user mode, which contains
//!   [`Shape`], [`Layout`] and [`BufType`].
//!
//! ThrillerFlow will generate the code of the ETDG by on-pass based on **Macro Kernel**
//! written in [TiledCUDA](https://github.com/TiledTensor/TiledCUDA).
